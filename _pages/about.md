<p> Hello there! My name is Shanshan Zhong, and I am a student from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Sun Yat-sem University, advised by Professor Wushao Wen and Professor Liang Lin. <br> My research interests primarily revolve around the application and structure design of generative models (including large language models and diffusion models), attention mechanism, and multimodal technology (including multimodal recommendation and multimodal information fusion).

Hi, I am Zhongzhan Huang (é»„ä¸­å±•), a Third-year Computer Science PhD student in Sun Yat-sen University, advised by
<a href="http://www.linliang.net/" target="_blank">Prof. Liang Lin</a>
in 
<a href="https://www.sysuhcp.com" target="_blank">Human-Cyber-Physical Intelligence Integration (HCP-l2)</a>
Lab.
My research interest include the foundations of deep learning (e.g. network pruning, design of effective network architectures, attention mechanism, large language models and diffusion models), and artificial intelligence for scientific problems.
